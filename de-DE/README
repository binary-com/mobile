### This is the de-DE readme file ####
In order to coordinate the work on the de-DE branch please subscribe first
to the mailing list: http://lists.alioth.debian.org/mailman/listinfo/debian-handbook-translators 

1) The current translator coordinator
As I think, I am the first translator here, I will do the coordination.
My name is Carsten Bachert. Please contact to caba@bachert.info for more information.

2) Name and email of the volunteers who contributed to the translation
Carsten Bachert - caba@bachert.info
Rainer Koenig - rainer@koenig-haunstetten.de

3) explanations (for new contributors) about the workflow that we use to

  3a) coordinate the work
      Kindliy have a look on the website www.debian-handbuch.de. There are
      pre translated chapters on a different degree of completion. 
      I will create a PO file and sent it to you while disabling working at
      the website. This is to insure that there are no different "branches".

  3b) translation choices that we made about the style to use, the vocabulary, etc.
      We use "Sie" and not "Du" four "you"

regards,
Carsten
