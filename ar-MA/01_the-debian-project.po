msgid "When he created Debian, in 1993, under the leadership of the FSF, Ian Murdock had clear objectives, which he expressed in the <emphasis>Debian Manifesto</emphasis>. The free operating system that he sought would have to have two principal features. First, quality: Debian would be developed with the greatest care, to be worthy of the Linux kernel. It would also be a non-commercial distribution, sufficiently credible to compete with major commercial distributions. This double ambition would, in his eyes, only be achieved by opening the Debian development process just like that of Linux and the GNU project. Thus, peer review would continuously improve the product."
msgstr "عندما أنشأ إيان موردوك دبيان، عام 1993، تحت لواء FSF، كانت لديه أهداف واضحة، عبّر عنها في <emphasis>بيان دبيان الرسمي</emphasis>. كان لنظام التشغيل الحر الذي أراده ميزتين أساسيتين. أولاً، الجودة: يجب تطوير دبيان بعناية فائقة، حتى تستحق نواة لينكس. ستكون أيضًا توزيعة غير تجارية، وموثوقة بما يكفي لتنافس التوزيعات التجارية الكبيرة. هذا الطموح المزدوج كان تحقيقه ممكنًا، بحسب نظرته، فقط من خلال فتح عملية تطوير دبيان تمامًا مثل لينكس ومشروع غنو. بالتالي، مراجعة النظراء ستحسن المنتج بشكل مستمر."

The selection of developers accepted in the teams may appear a bit arbitrary, or even unfair. Furthermore, not everybody has the same definition of the service expected from these teams. For some, it is unacceptable to have to wait eight days for inclusion of a new Debian package, while others will wait patiently for three weeks without a problem.
