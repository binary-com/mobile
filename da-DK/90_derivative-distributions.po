Even though this situation has improved over the years, many have been irked by the Canonical marketing, which implied Ubuntu were good citizens in the Free Software world simply because they made public the changes they applied to Debian packages. Free Software proponents understand that an automatically-generated patch is of little use to the upstream contribution process. Getting one's work integrated requires direct interaction with the other party."
