In this case, the proper procedure is to report the bug to Debian or directly to the upstream developers. To do this, isolate the problem as much as possible and create a minimal test situation in which it can be reproduced. If you know which program is the apparent cause of the problem, you can find its corresponding package using the command, <command>dpkg -S <replaceable>file_in_question</replaceable></command>. Check the Bug Tracking System (<literal>http://bugs.debian.org/<replaceable>package</replaceable></literal>) to ensure that the bug has not already been reported. You can then send your own bug report, using the <command>reportbug</command> command, including as much information as possible, especially a complete description of those minimal test cases that will allow anyone to recreate the bug."
