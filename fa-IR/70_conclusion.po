msgid "The default “init” process (<command>sysvinit</command>) will hopefully be replaced by a more modern system such as <command>upstart</command> or <command>systemd</command>. Some ports will be gone: <literal>s390</literal> has been superseded by <literal>s390x</literal>, <literal>sparc</literal> and <literal>ia64</literal> might follow as they suffer from multiple problems (lack of recent hardware, lack of Debian porters, lack of upstream support, etc.). <command>dpkg</command> will gain a <command>--verify</command> command that renders <command>debsums</command> mostly obsolete."

msgid "Of course, all the main software suites will have had a major release. Apache 2.4 (or newer) will have a strong impact on deployed websites as many configuration files will have to be updated. The Linux kernel is likely to have a much improved container support (with user namespaces, paving the path towards more secure containers). And the latest version of the various desktops will bring better usability and new features. GNOME 3 will be much more polished and the fans of the good old GNOME 2 will be pleased with the inclusion of <ulink url=\"http://mate-desktop.org/\">MATE</ulink> in Debian."

msgid "In spite of its old age and its respectable size, Debian keeps on growing in all kinds of (sometimes unexpected) directions. Contributors are teeming with ideas, and discussions on development mailing lists, even when they look like bickerings, keep increasing the momentum. Debian is sometimes compared to a black hole, of such density that any new free software project is attracted."

msgid "Beyond the apparent satisfaction of most Debian users, a deep trend is becoming more and more indisputable: people are increasingly realising that collaborating, rather than working alone in their corner, leads to better results for everyone. Such is the rationale used by distributions merging into Debian by way of subprojects."
