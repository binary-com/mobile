Notes about the debian-handbook package
---------------------------------------

This package only provides the HTML version of the book to limit the
package size. Providing other formats would double or triple its size.

You can however download PDF and EPUB versions of this book on
its website:
http://debian-handbook.info/get/

Alternatively you can build those files from sources. Download the source
package with "apt-get source debian-handbook" and run build/build-pdf
to build the PDF version or build/build-epub to build the EPUB version.
