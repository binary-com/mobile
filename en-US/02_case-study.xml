  <title>Presenting the Case Study</title>
  <highlights>
    <para>In the context of this book, you are the system
    administrator of a growing small business. The time has come for
    you to redefine the information systems master plan for the coming
    year in collaboration with your directors.  You choose to
    progressively migrate to Debian, both for practical and economical
    reasons. Let's see into more detail what's in store for you…</para>
  </highlights>

  <para>We have envisioned this case study to approach all modern
  information system services currently used in a medium sized company.
  After reading this book, you will have all of the elements necessary to
  install Debian on your servers and fly on your own wings. You will also
  learn how to efficiently find information in the event of
  difficulties.</para>

    <title>Fast Growing IT Needs</title>

    <para>Falcot Corp is a manufacturer of high quality audio
    equipment.  The company is growing strongly, and has two
    facilities, one in Saint-Étienne, and another in Montpellier. The
    former has around 150 employees; it hosts a factory for the
    manufacturing of speakers, a design lab, and all administrative
    office. The Montpellier site is smaller, with only about 50
    workers, and produces amplifiers.</para>

      <title><emphasis>NOTE</emphasis> Fictional company created for case study</title>

      <para>The Falcot Corp company used as an example here is
      completely fictional. Any resemblance to an existing company is
      purely coincidental. Likewise, some example data throughout
      this book may be fictional.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>The computer system has had difficulty keeping up with the
    company's growth, so they are now determined to completely redefine it
    to meet various goals established by management:</para>

    <para>With your collaboration, IT management has conducted a slightly
    more extensive study, identifying some constraints and defining a plan
    for migration to the chosen Open Source system, Debian.</para>

    <para>A significant constraint identified is that the accounting
    department uses specific software, which only runs on
    <trademark>Microsoft Windows</trademark>. The laboratory, for its part,
    uses computer aided design software that runs on
    <trademark>OS X</trademark>.</para>

    <para>The switch to Debian will be gradual; a small business, with
    limited means, cannot reasonably change everything overnight. For
    starters, the IT staff must be trained in Debian
    administration. The servers will then be converted, starting with
    the network infrastructure (routers, firewalls, etc.) followed by
    the user services (file sharing, Web, SMTP, etc.). Then the office
    computers will be gradually migrated to Debian, for each
    department to be trained (internally) during the deployment of the
    new system.</para>

  <section id="sect.why-gnu-linux">
    <title>Why a GNU/Linux Distribution?</title>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>BACK TO BASICS</emphasis> Linux or GNU/Linux?</title>
      <indexterm><primary>GNU/Linux</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Linux</primary></indexterm>

      <para>Linux, as you already know, is only a kernel. The expressions,
      “Linux distribution” and “Linux system” are, thus, incorrect:
      they are, in reality, distributions or systems <emphasis>based
      on</emphasis> Linux. These expressions fail to mention the software
      that always complete this kernel, among which are the programs
      developed by the GNU Project. Dr. Richard Stallman, founder of this
      project, insists that the expression “GNU/Linux” be
      systematically used, in order to better recognize the important
      contributions made by the GNU Project and the principles of freedom
      upon which they are founded.</para>

      <!-- MAYCHANGE: version number -->
      <para>Debian has chosen to follow this recommendation, and, thus,
      name its distributions accordingly (thus, the latest stable release
      is Debian GNU/Linux 7).</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Several factors have dictated this choice. The system
    administrator, who was familiar with this distribution, ensured it
    was listed among the candidates for the computer system
    overhaul. Difficult economic conditions and ferocious competition
    have limited the budget for this operation, despite its critical
    importance for the future of the company. This is why Open Source
    solutions were swiftly chosen: several recent studies indicate
    they are less expensive than proprietary solutions while providing
    equal or better quality of service so long as qualified personnel
    are available to run them.</para>

    <sidebar>
      <title><emphasis>IN PRACTICE</emphasis> Total cost of ownership (TCO)</title>
      <indexterm><primary>TCO</primary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>Total Cost of Ownership</primary></indexterm>

      <para>The Total Cost of Ownership is the total of all money expended
      for the possession or acquisition of an item, in this case referring
      to the operating system. This price includes any possible license fee,
      costs for training personnel to work with the new software,
      replacement of machines that are too slow, additional repairs, etc.
      Everything arising directly from the initial choice is taken into
      account.</para>

      <para>This TCO, which varies according to the criteria chosen in
      the assessment thereof, is rarely significant when taken in
      isolation. However, it is very interesting to compare TCOs for
      different options if they are calculated according to the same
      rules. This assessment table is, thus, of paramount importance,
      and it is easy to manipulate it in order to draw a predefined
      conclusion.  Thus, the TCO for a single machine doesn't make
      sense, since the cost of an administrator is also reflected in
      the total number of machines they manage, a number which
      obviously depends on the operating system and tools
      proposed.</para>
    </sidebar>

    <para>Among free operating systems, the IT department looked at
    the free BSD systems (OpenBSD, FreeBSD, and NetBSD), GNU Hurd, and
    Linux distributions. GNU Hurd, which has not yet released a stable
    version, was immediately rejected. The choice is simpler between
    BSD and Linux.  The former have many merits, especially on
    servers. Pragmatism, however, led to choosing a Linux system,
    since its installed base and popularity are both very significant
    and have many positive consequences. One of these consequences is
    that it is easier to find qualified personnel to administer Linux
    machines than technicians experienced with BSD. Furthermore, Linux
    adapts to newer hardware faster than BSD (although they are often
    neck and neck in this race).  Finally, Linux distributions are
    often more adapted to user-friendly graphical user interfaces,
    indispensable for beginners during migration of all office
    machines to a new system.</para>

      <para>Since Debian <emphasis
      role="distribution">Squeeze</emphasis>, it is possible to use
      Debian with a FreeBSD kernel on 32 and 64 bit computers; this is
      what the <literal>kfreebsd-i386</literal> and
      <literal>kfreebsd-amd64</literal> architectures mean. While
      these architectures are labeled “experimental” (Technology
      Preview), about 90 % of the software packaged by Debian is
      available for them.</para>

      <para>These architectures may be an appropriate choice for Falcot
      Corp administrators, especially for a firewall (the kernel supports
      three different firewalls: IPF, IPFW, PF) or for a NAS (network
      attached storage system, for which the ZFS filesystem has been tested
      and approved).</para>
    </sidebar>
  </section>
  <section id="sect.why-debian">
    <title>Why the Debian Distribution?</title>

    <para>Once the Linux family has been selected, a more specific
    option must be chosen. Again, there are plenty of criteria to
    consider. The chosen distribution must be able to operate for
    several years, since the migration from one to another would
    entail additional costs (although less than if the migration were
    between two totally different operating systems, such as Windows
    or OS X).</para>

    <para>Sustainability is, thus, essential, and it must guarantee regular
    updates and security patches over several years. The timing of updates
    is also significant, since, with so many machines to manage, Falcot
    Corp can not handle this complex operation too frequently. The IT
    department, therefore, insists on running the latest stable version of
    the distribution, benefiting from the best technical assistance, and
    guaranteed security patches. In effect, security updates are generally
    only guaranteed for a limited duration on older versions of a
    distribution.</para>

    <para>Finally, for reasons of homogeneity and ease of administration,
    the same distribution must run on all the servers (some of which are
    Sparc machines, currently running Solaris) and office computers.</para>
    <section>
      <title>Commercial and Community Driven Distributions</title>

      <para>There are two main categories of Linux distributions:
      commercial and community driven. The former, developed by companies,
      are sold with commercial support services. The latter are developed
      according to the same open development model as the free software of
      which they are comprised.</para>

      <para>A commercial distribution will have, thus, a tendency to
      release new versions more frequently, in order to better market
      updates and associated services. Their future is directly connected
      to the commercial success of their company, and many have already
      disappeared (Caldera Linux, StormLinux, etc.).</para>

      <para>A community distribution doesn't follow any schedule but its
      own. Like the Linux kernel, new versions are released when they are
      stable, never before. Its survival is guaranteed, as long as it has
      enough individual developers or third party companies to support
      it.</para>
      <indexterm><primary>distribution</primary><secondary>community Linux distribution</secondary></indexterm>
      <indexterm><primary>distribution</primary><secondary>commercial Linux distribution</secondary></indexterm>

      <para>A comparison of various Linux distributions led to the choice
      of Debian for various reasons:</para>
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
	  <para>It is a community distribution, with development ensured
	  independently from any commercial constraints; its objectives
	  are, thus, essentially of a technical nature, which seem to favor
	  the overall quality of the product.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Of all community distributions, it is the most significant
	  from many perspectives: in number of contributors, number of
	  software packages available, and years of continuous existence.
	  The size of its community is an incontestable witness to its
	  continuity.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Statistically, new versions are released every 18 to 24
	  months, a schedule which is agreeable to administrators.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>A survey of several French service companies specialized in
	  free software has shown that all of them provide technical
	  assistance for Debian; it is also, for many of them, their chosen
	  distribution, internally. This diversity of potential providers
	  is a major asset for Falcot Corp's independence.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
	  <para>Finally, Debian is available on a multitude of
	  architectures, including Sparc; it will, thus, be possible to
	  install it on Falcot Corp's several Sun servers.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>Once Debian has been chosen, the matter of which version to use
      must be decided. Let us see why the administrators have picked Debian
      Wheezy.</para>
    </section>
  </section>
  <section id="sect.why-debian-stable">
    <title>Why Debian Wheezy?</title>

    <para>Every Debian release starts its life as a continuously changing
    distribution, also known as “<emphasis
    role="distribution">Testing</emphasis>”. But at the time when you
    will read those lines, Debian Wheezy should be the latest “<emphasis
    role="distribution">Stable</emphasis>” version of Debian.</para>

    <para>The choice of Debian Wheezy is well justified based on the fact
    that any administrator concerned about the quality of their servers
    will naturally gravitate towards the stable version of Debian.
    Even if the previous stable release might still be supported for a
    while, Falcot administrators aren't considering it because its
    support period will not last long enough and because the latest
    version brings new interesting features that they care about.</para>
