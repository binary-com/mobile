The Linux kernel is likely to have a much improved container support (with user namespaces, paving the path towards more secure containers). And the latest version of the various desktops will bring better usability and new features. GNOME 3 will be much more polished and the fans of the good old GNOME 2 will be pleased with the inclusion of <ulink url=\"http://mate-desktop.org/\">MATE</ulink> in Debian."

Debian is sometimes compared to a black hole, of such density that any new free software project is attracted."
msgstr "尽管Debian发展了很多年，规模也很大了，但是Debian依然在向各种方向发展（有时候也会向你意想不到的方向）。Debian的贡献者们非常了想法，他们通过开发邮件列表来讨论，甚至他们看起来像是在吵架，正是这些给Debian提供了持续的动力。Debian有时候可以比作是一个黑洞，如此的有吸引力以至于任何新的自由软件项目都可以吸纳进来。"
