msgid "<emphasis>CrossOver</emphasis>, produced by CodeWeavers, is a set of enhancements to Wine that broaden the available set of emulated features to a point at which Microsoft Office becomes fully usable. Some of the enhancements are periodically merged into Wine. <ulink type=\"block\" url=\"http://www.codeweavers.com/products/\" />"

msgid "The user then needs to run <command>winecfg</command> and configure which (Debian) locations are mapped to which (Windows) drives. <command>winecfg</command> has some sane defaults and can autodetect some more drives; note that even if you have a dual-boot system, you should not point the <literal>C:</literal> drive at where the Windows partition is mounted in Debian, as Wine is likely to overwrite some of the data on that partition, making Windows unusable. Other settings can be kept to their default values. To run Windows programs, you will first need to install them by running their (Windows) installer under Wine, with a command such as <command>wine <replaceable>.../setup.exe</replaceable></command>; once the program is installed, you can run it with <command>wine <replaceable>.../program.exe</replaceable></command>. The exact location of the <filename>program.exe</filename> file depends on where the <literal>C:</literal> drive is mapped; in many cases, however, simply running <command>wine <replaceable>program</replaceable></command> will work, since the program is usually installed in a location where Wine will look for it by itself."
